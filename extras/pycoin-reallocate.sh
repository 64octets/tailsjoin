# This script will clone and install pycoin (https://github.com/richardkiss/pycoin), create, sign, and push a 
# transaction in order to clean up your JoinMarket wallet. This is specifically for use with bitcoin core and the 
# Tails live operating system (https://tails.boum.org), and will not work without a local bitcoin client. I may make
# one that uses a web service too. When either a tumble session fails, or when acting as a maker one often ends up
# with random funds spread accross random depths. This is hopefully a simple way to reallocate or move these funds.
# nothing is ever pushed to the network until you give the "OK" at the very end of the script. So there is no worry
# in testing, quiting, and testing again.
#
# Use at your own risk, and be aware of your own skill level. Keep a calculator handy as the script does not do math
# for you.
