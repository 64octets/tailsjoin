# tailsjoin
## Script to install JoinMarket and dependencies on Tails OS.

You must start Tails with "More options" setting in the beginning (Persistence is optional) and set an administrator password.

    cd /home/amnesia/Persistent (optional)
    git clone https://github.com/tailsjoin/tailsjoin
    cd tailsjoin
    ./tailsjoin.sh
    
Be aware, the script will prompt for the administrator password several times throughout.

After installation you will have to add `torify` to every [command](https://github.com/tailsjoin/tailsjoin/commit/0b42441277dfe77bccfefe6075cb688c0b603e4a) that does blockchain lookups:

    torify python wallet-tool.py <walletfile>
    torify python sendpayment.py -N 4 <amount> <address>
