# tailsjoin
## Scripts to install [JoinMarket](https://github.com/chris-belcher/joinmarket), [Bitcoin v.11](https://bitcoin.org/en/download), and dependencies on [Tails live OS](https://tails.boum.org).

### Options for Tails.

1. Run on a minimal system without enough disk space to run bitcoin core.

2. Run on either a system with enough disk space to hold an indexed blockchain, or a minimal system with the enough external storage to store the blockchain (60GB~)

---

### Steps for a system with minimal disk space.

You must start Tails with "More options" setting in the beginning (Persistence is optional) and set an administrator password no matter which script you run.

The script is signed with my gpg key: [0x1B9184DF9E117718](https://github.com/tailsjoin/tailsjoin/wiki/GnuPG-Key)

    cd /home/amnesia/Persistent (optional)
    git clone https://github.com/tailsjoin/tailsjoin
    cd tailsjoin
    gpg --recv-keys 44C5398EA821BB41A0C070521B9184DF9E117718
    gpg --verify tailsjoin.sh.asc tailsjoin.sh
    ./tailsjoin.sh
    
Be aware, the script will prompt for the administrator password several times throughout.

After installation you will have to add `torify` to every [command](https://github.com/tailsjoin/tailsjoin/commit/0b42441277dfe77bccfefe6075cb688c0b603e4a) that does blockchain lookups because the minimal setup uses blockr.io (Coinbase):

    torify python wallet-tool.py <wallet_file>
    torify python sendpayment.py -P -N 4 <amount> <destination_address>
